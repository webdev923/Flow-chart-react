# React Flow Chart

### A work in progress. 

This project aims to build a highly customisable flow chart library. Critically, your control the state. Pick from Redux, MobX, React or any other state managment library. Simply pass in the current state and hook up the callbacks.

For example:

![demo](./images/demo.gif)


## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run start:storybook
```
