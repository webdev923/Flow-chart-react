# React Flow Chart

## WORK IN PROGRESS

### [Demo](https://mrblenny.github.io/react-flow-chart/index.html?selectedKind=With%20Sidebar&selectedStory=default&full=0&addons=1&stories=1&panelRight=0&addonPanel=storybook-addon-viewport%2Faddon-panel)

This project aims to build a highly customisable, declarative flow chart library. Critically, your control the state. Pick from Redux, MobX, React or any other state managment library - simply pass in the current state and hook up the callbacks.

For example:

## Contributing

If you're interested in helping out, let me know. 

In particular, would be great to get a hand making redux and mobx integrations.

## Install

Probably best not to use npm at this point. Things will be changing wildly.

```bash
npm i @mrblenny/react-flow-chart
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run start:storybook
```
